# Goal CRUD Application Coding Challenge

Welcome to the Goal CRUD Application coding challenge! The objective of this challenge is to create a goal management application with the following features and requirements.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Goal Management:**
   - **Create Goal:**
     - Form fields: Title (required), Description, Goal Owner, Start Date, End Date, Parent Goal (optional).
     - Use the provided `POST /goals` endpoint to create a goal.

     - Display a list of all goals.
     - Implement a tree view where users can drag and drop to change the parent goal without opening an edit modal.
     - Show goal details including title, description, goal owner, start date, end date, parent goal.
     - Use the provided `GET /goals` endpoint to fetch goals.
   - **Update Goal:**
     - Update the details of a goal (title, description, goal owner, start date, end date, parent goal).
     - Ensure the goal progress edit UX is intuitive and user-friendly.
     - Use the provided `PUT /goals/:id` endpoint to update a goal.
   - **Delete Goal:**
     - Remove a goal.
     - Use the provided `DELETE /goals/:id` endpoint to delete a goal.

2. **User Management:**
   - **Get Users:**
     - Fetch the list of users to select a goal owner.
     - Use the provided `GET /users` endpoint to fetch users.

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Responsive UI:**
   - Ensure the application is responsive and works well on various screen sizes.

2. **Animations:**
   - Include smooth and user-friendly animations for UI interactions.

3. **Caching:**
   - Implement caching where appropriate to improve performance.
